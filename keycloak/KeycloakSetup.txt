The Keycloak setup is now fully integrated with this POC WildFly build.  The Keycloak master relam is pre-populated with definitions for the Web Console and the http management endpoint.

Login to the Web Console
1. Go to http://localhost:9990/console/ and log in.  Other console URLs such as http://localhost:9990/console/App.html will not work until you are logged in.
2. There is a predefined user for the master realm named "stan" with password set to "password".
3. If you click on your user name in the upper righthand corner of web console you can see the role you were assigned.  You will only be allowed to view/change things that you have rights to view/change.
4. You can also directly hit the http management endpoint by going to http://localhost:9990/management.  You will not need to log in again because the two applications are in the same realm. Single Signon!

Login to Keycloak Admin
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/index.html
2. You don't need to log in because the Web Console and Keycloak Admin share an SSO realm.
3. In Keycloak admin, you can view active sessions and drill down to see who is logged in.
4. You can also view the audit log.

Change a role for a Web Console user
1. Go to Keycloak Admin
2. Go to master->Users->stan->Role Mappings
3. Select the web-console application and change the role
4. Do the same for the http-endpoint application and change to the same role
5. Log out of the realm.
6. Log into Web Console and see that the role has changed.
